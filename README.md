# CS61B Project 3: Build Your Own World (BYOW)
Overview
This project, completed as part of UC Berkeley's CS61B (Data Structures) course, is an engine for generating and exploring pseudo-randomly generated 2D tile-based worlds. It involves the design and implementation of complex data structures and algorithms to create unique, explorable environments based on a given seed. Users can navigate these worlds, interact with elements, and save/load their progress.

Features
Pseudo-random World Generation: Generates unique and diverse 2D tile-based worlds with distinct rooms, hallways, and outdoor spaces.

Interactive Exploration: Allows users to navigate the generated world using keyboard inputs.

Persistent Worlds: Implements functionality to save and load the state of a generated world, allowing users to continue their exploration.

Heads-Up Display (HUD): Provides real-time information to the user, such as the type of tile currently under the mouse pointer.

How to Run
Clone the Repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]

Compile:
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Navigate to the root directory of the project and compile the source files:

javac -encoding utf8 @sources.txt

(Note: sources.txt should contain a list of all .java files in your project, typically generated by the CS61B build system.)

Run:
Execute the main class (e.g., byow.Core.Main):

java byow.Core.Main

This will launch the world generation engine. 

Relevance to Data Analysis
While this project is implemented in Java and focuses on data structures and algorithms, the core principles and challenges addressed are highly analogous to those encountered in data analysis and data engineering:

Complex Data Modeling and Representation: The project required designing intricate data structures (e.g., graphs, custom tile objects, spatial representations) to effectively model a dynamic and interconnected 2D world. This directly demonstrates my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement robust data models for complex datasets.

Algorithmic Data Generation and Synthesis: The world generation process is essentially a form of data synthesis. I developed algorithms to programmatically create diverse "data points" (tiles, rooms, hallways) and ensure they adhere to specific rules and constraints (e.g., connectivity, no dead ends, random yet coherent layouts). This showcases my skill in generating, manipulating, and transforming data programmatically.

Efficient Data Retrieval and Manipulation: Navigating the world, saving its state, and loading it back required efficient methods for data retrieval and manipulation. This project honed my ability to optimize data access patterns and manage large sets of interconnected information.

Problem-Solving and Logical Design: Building this engine demanded strong logical reasoning and problem-solving skills to manage various states, handle user input, and ensure the integrity of the generated data. These are critical skills for any data analyst tasked with cleaning, transforming, and validating datasets.

My experience with this project, combined with my proficiency in Python and R (as highlighted in my resume), positions me well to tackle data collection, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis tasks for the Equity Metrics Program. The foundational understanding of data organization and algorithmic processing gained from Project 3 is directly transferable to working with public datasets and developing data-driven diagnostic tools.
